For all future devs or people who have forked this repo. I am Marcello Alaniz. I'll explain some of the orangization.
Marcs_assets is a folder when I was in my dev stage and I would like nothing to be saved there it helps maintain who's 
work is who's when you need to reference items.

OldWixWebsite was created on wix and is a mess to even code around with since all the variable names are the worst. 
If the manyotter team asks you look at the previous style it will stay on this repo unless we exceed the 2gb Github 
free storage.

Templates is where I kept the Editioral HTML page which was created by 
<!--
	Editorial by HTML5 UP
	html5up.net | @ajlkn
	Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)
-->

as you can see in each page. Now as you can see I heavily revamped a lot of the resources so I do not take credit for 
the style of the elements like the lines or sidebar. I did create the color scheme to match the current 2024 Many Otters 
Banner. The 'assets' folder is strictly to contain the style elements by html5up and shoud not be removed and preferabley 
not be added to. the generic page is the page you will use to create new templates in the style of the website. 

NOTE!
DO NOT REMOVE google199de54d0e2bc4c3.html as that is the verification for the GOOGLE SEO and if it is removed  Many Otters 
as of 2024 Summer will be removed off the serach results when searched. Now this can change I'm not 100% on how the 'spiders' 
for SEOs work but once the other many many projects link us to them we should be okay.
Testing page.html  was just a place for me to test stuff. Addtionaly The wix page is a bit easier to work with if you ever 
revert to that as I created a javascript sidebar that was far better then the first edtion wix site. NOTE Wix doesn't 
let users download source code so the wix code in the folder is messy for that reason. 

Thank you - Marcello A. June 2024.
